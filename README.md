# Image Processing Basics OpenCV
## Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental image processing operations using Python and OpenCV.  
It includes basic transformations such as resizing, cropping, pixel manipulation, and mirroring.The goal of this project is to understand how images are represented as matrices and how pixel-level operations work. The image is downloaded dynamically from a URL when the script runs.

## Features
- Resize an image
- Crop using mouse selection (ROI)
- Center crop
- Pixel color modification
- Horizontal mirroring (flip)
- Add grayscale conversion
- Add edge detection (Canny)
- Add image filtering techniques
  
## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
  
## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install opencv-python
2. Run the script:
   python wall-e.py
